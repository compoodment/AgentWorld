# Phase 2 Owner Device Pairing

The private Tailnet provides encrypted transport and limits network reachability.
It is **not** authority to inspect or control a world. Phase 2 grants owner
access only to a specifically paired device.

## Pairing flow

1. A Windows client creates a non-exportable current-user CNG P-256 signing
   key locally. Its non-secret pairing registration metadata lives under the
   app user's storage, while the private key remains in the Windows key store.
   The server receives only the public key and its fingerprint.
2. The unpaired client requests a pairing record. The server returns an opaque
   pairing ID, a short human-verification code, and a short expiry. The code is
   a comparison value, not a credential. Pairing and challenge state is bounded;
   a pairing also expires after a bounded number of incorrect visible-code
   attempts instead of becoming a durable brute-force target.
3. A host-local bootstrap administrator approves the matching pairing ID and
   code through a separate loopback-only listener. There is no bootstrap
   password or reusable approval secret in the client, a URL, or deployment
   configuration. Once an owner device exists, it may approve or revoke further
   devices through signed owner-device-management requests. It may also request
   the signed registry of paired-device lifecycle records. The registry exposes
   only public device IDs, public-key fingerprints, and lifecycle state; it
   never exposes private keys, comparison codes, or reusable challenges. The
   same separate host-local listener supports recovery revocation when every
   paired Windows device has been lost or revoked.
4. The device proves possession of its private key before activation. The
   server records its public-key fingerprint, fixed owner scope, and durable
   activation/revocation state. Private keys and raw approval codes never enter
   world saves, snapshots, event projections, or logs.
5. Each read or control request carries a short-lived server challenge and a
   signature over canonical request data. The server consumes the challenge
   once and persists that consumption before asking the runtime to commit. It
   derives the durable issuer from the active device; the runtime mints durable
   IDs, event ordering, and submission sequence. A client request ID and
   idempotency key are signed ingress values, not ownership claims.

The initial host-local approval route is deliberately separate from normal
network requests. For this private deployment, the owner can relay the short
comparison code through the already trusted direct-control channel; that
channel approves a pending pairing only, never supplies the device key.

Owner pairing and signed control traffic require HTTPS. Literal loopback IPs
are the sole plaintext exception, for an explicit local-development host.

The headless host persists paired-device authority separately from the world
runtime. The authority file contains public keys, fingerprints, state, and
anti-replay hashes—not device private keys or raw comparison codes. The runtime
file contains world state and never becomes credential storage. Both files are
written atomically and use owner-only filesystem permissions on Unix hosts.

## Server-origin binding

An owner key is not a portable bearer credential for arbitrary URLs. Both a
pending pairing and an activated local registration are bound to one canonical
server origin. The client permits remote HTTPS origins, with literal loopback
HTTP only for explicit local development; paths, queries, fragments, and
userinfo are not accepted as part of an origin.

While pairing is pending, polling and activation remain at the origin that
issued the pairing record. The client verifies the expected server authority,
device ID, and public-key fingerprint before it saves an activated
registration. Once paired, an edited URL or command-line value cannot silently
retarget the registered owner key. Changing servers is an explicit local
operation: forget the registration and pair to the new server. The persisted
authority and world identities provide a second binding beyond the transport
origin.

## Response-loss recovery

Instructions and paused-authoring batches are server-idempotent, but a client
can still lose the response after the server commits one. Before sending either
kind of request, the Godot client may atomically retain one non-secret pending
record. It is bound to the authority identity, device ID, public-key
fingerprint, and canonical server origin, and preserves the exact instruction
idempotency key or authoring batch ID.

The user can explicitly retry that one record. The retry obtains a new one-use
challenge and signature, then submits the same logical request so the server
returns the original receipt rather than creating a duplicate. This is not a
general offline queue: only one request is retained, it cannot cross a pairing
or origin boundary, and it can be explicitly forgotten. The record never
contains a private key, signature, challenge, comparison code, or bearer
credential.

## Approved authored assets

Paused authoring may name an asset reference only when its exact normalized
`assetId` and lowercase `sha256:<64-hex>` digest appear in the immutable,
host-owned approved-asset catalog loaded at process startup. A missing catalog
is an empty deny-all catalog. An existing catalog that is malformed, ambiguous,
or has an unknown schema prevents host startup; the host never guesses or
partially trusts a catalog update. Owner-device requests cannot modify the
catalog or upload asset bytes. This narrow Phase 2 reference policy is not yet
the later content-proposal or provenance pipeline.

## Phase 2 scope

Every paired device has the sole `owner` scope: world observation,
pause/resume, instruction submission, authoring-batch submission, and device
management. There are no viewer, operator, or multiplayer roles yet. A revoked
device immediately loses access. Authority state retains non-secret public-key
fingerprints and device IDs; world-side control events retain a non-secret
server-derived issuer string, never a private key or comparison code.

All world-changing requests remain requests. Authentication permits the server
to validate and enqueue them; only the authoritative runtime commits the
result. Unpaired devices receive neither full-world observations nor control
results. The unauthenticated HTTP surface therefore exposes only protocol
discovery, not world observation or a second owner interface. Legacy static
diagnostic assets are not a supported game client.

## Required evidence

Phase 2 completion evidence must cover expiry, bounded failed-code attempts,
invalid proof, replayed challenge, revocation, unpaired read/write denial,
owner-only observation, server-derived issuer/tick/sequence, idempotent control
submission, paired-origin binding, signed registry/approval/revocation,
response-loss retry, approved-asset allow/deny handling, and authority/runtime
recovery across restart. The Windows client must prove it can create/store a
device key, complete a paired reconnect, and reject a server response that
lacks the negotiated owner capability. The export path must be verified
separately from a real Windows 11 owner test; the latter is not implied by a
Linux CI export.
